In case of any questions, we would recommend for you to join our Pinax Slack team (http://slack.pinaxproject.com) and ping us there instead of creating an issue on GitHub. Creating issues on GitHub is of course also valid but we are usually able to help you faster if you ping us in Slack.

We would also highly recommend for your to read our Open Source and Self-Care blog post (http://blog.pinaxproject.com/2016/01/19/open-source-and-self-care/).
